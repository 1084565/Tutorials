### Optional

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Troubleshooting the SAP Web IDE)]
Are you having trouble opening SAP Web IDE Full-Stack? If you are seeing a 501/503 error, it may be that your principal propagation flag is not set properly.

To enable your principal propagation flag, in your SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit, click **Security** then **Trust**.

If the **Principal Propagation** flag is set to _Default_ or _Disabled_, you will need to update it. Click **Edit**.

Change the value of **Principal Propagation** to _Enabled_ and **Save**.
